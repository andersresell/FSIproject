Project for my Master's thesis. The goal is to develop an explicit Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) solver that uses 
a Finite Volume (FVM) solver in the fluid domain to solve the compressible Euler equations. How the solid domain 
is treated is yet TBD. The purpose of the solver is to study shock and it's applications to blast loading.
