Project for my Master's thesis, where the goal was to develop a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver for shock-tube applications. The result is a 2D cartesian grid solver for the compressible Euler equations, coupled with rigid bodies and enforcing boundary conditions with a ghost cell immersed boundary method. The fluid solver uses the HLLC riemann solver and second-order MUSCL extrapolation along with the third-order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta method for time integration.
Note that the code is not completely finished, and bugs are still present. An overall restructure of the code might also be beneficial.
